## Step 1: 
When you start a container, Docker will track the Standard Out and Standard Error outputs from the process and make them available via the client.

Example
In the background, there is an instance of Redis running with the name redis-server. Using the Docker client, we can access the standard out and standard error outputs using

```bash
docker logs redis-server
```

## Step 2 - SysLog
By default, the Docker logs are outputting using the json-file logger meaning the output stored in a JSON file on the host. This can result in large files filling the disk. As a result, you can change the log driver to move to a different destination.

The Syslog log driver will write all the container logs to the central syslog on the host. "syslog is a widely used standard for message logging. It permits separation of the software that generates messages, the system that stores them, and the software that reports and analyses them." Wikipedia

This log-driver is designed to be used when syslog is being collected and aggregated by an external system.

The command below will redirect the redis logs to syslog.

```bash
docker run -d --name redis-syslog --log-driver=syslog redis
```

## Accessing Logs

If you atempted to view the logs using the client you'll recieve the error FATA[0000] "logs" command is supported only for "json-file" logging driver

Instead, you need to access them via the syslog stream.



## Step 3: Disable Logging

The third option is to disable logging on the container. This is particularly useful for containers which are very verbose in their logging.

When the container is launched simply set the log-driver to none. No output will be logged.

```bash
docker run -d --name redis-none --log-driver=none redis
```

#### Which Config?
The inspect command allows you to identify the logging configuration for a particular container. The command below will output the LogConfig section for each of the containers.

Server created in step 1

```bash
docker inspect --format '{{ .HostConfig.LogConfig }}' redis-server
```

Server created in step 2

```bash
docker inspect --format '{{ .HostConfig.LogConfig }}' redis-syslog
```

Server created in this step

```bash
docker inspect --format '{{ .HostConfig.LogConfig }}' redis-none
```
